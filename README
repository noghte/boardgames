## Topic modeling for boardgames

First, I have created a conda environment:

conda create -n env-topicmodeling python=3.7.5

conda activate env-topicmodeling

 

Then, installed pandas, gensim, and nltk libraries:

conda install pandas gensim

conda install -c anaconda nltk

 

Then, installed spacy for English:

conda install -c conda-forge spacy

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Other comments are in the notebook, you can see how to change the number of topics in comments as well.
